👨‍👩‍👧 Learning to parent while parenting my lovely daughter.

🤖 Working on digital communication projects at Rentschler Biopharma.

💻 Working on a major update of my site. Focusing on learning native web components.

🎶 Practicing [Cahir's Kitchen](https://thesession.org/tunes/1090) song on my low D [tin whistle](/tunes/).

🐉 Playing Dungeons & Dragons 5e both as a Halfling Calligrapher Warlock called Nim Inkwell 🧙🏻 and a Tabaxi Barbarian called Ban K'nurr an Tauira 😸. I am also a Dungeon Master in a custom campaign that plays in the beautiful and peaceful region around Sí Bheg, Sí Mhor when suddenly a dark ancient cult arises. Currently, I am playing online due to COVID restrictions.

💪 Testing the minimalist Calisthenics program by [Kyle Boggeman](https://www.kboges.com/).
